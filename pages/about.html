						"The greatest assurance of quality we can give is a <em>genuine passion</em> for our craft."
					</div>
					<div class="column">
						What does it mean to "feel at home?" It is not just a location, it is not just family or friends; home is a unique feeling.  Home is solace; home is a comforting sense of familiarity. Home is peace of mind and we hope that you find a little of that in us, Homeroot Creations, and our craft. Every ingredient we use is the freshest and the most natural, so, rest assured: what we use will only improve your well-being. After all, <em>health is a gift that deserves to be protected.</em><br><br>
						Together, we create art through beauty. You are the canvas; our soaps, body scrubs, and lotions are the medium, delicately crafted and uniquely tailored to every possible need imaginable. Like a painter slaving over his masterpiece, our dedication to you is unparalleled. The tireless hours and unwavering effort that we, Homeroot Creations, put in is worth it for you to progress towards a stronger and healthier "you."
					</div>
					<div class="column">
						We love what we do. We are proud of what we make, and for this reason, the products that we sell are the very same ones we use. In adopting a "back to the basics" movement, we champion the elegant simplicity of handmade artisan craft that is created with the well-being of others in mind. This means no chemical additives, no more toxins. Everything is natural, everything is fresh. That is our Homeroot Creations promise to you.<br><br>
						We were once you: with oily or dry skin, with the rashes that would not go away or the incessant break outs. So we understand the frustration when our skin is less than flawless. However, clean and healthy skin should not be a far fetched dream that is just out of our reach, it should be a daily achievement, and if you're not there yet, we can help you with that. We understand that one generic bar of soap cannot possibly fix every type of skin out there (in fact, it might create more problems). That is why we share the same values for all natural and organic goods.
